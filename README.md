# Zomato-Rating-Prediction
"Predict restaurant ratings using ML. Python script for data preprocessing, Random Forest Regressor training, and rating prediction."

This project focuses on predicting restaurant ratings using a machine learning model. The Python script provided covers the entire process, from data preprocessing to model training and prediction.

## Overview

- `restaurant_rating_prediction.py`: This script loads a restaurant dataset, performs data preprocessing including handling missing values and one-hot encoding categorical features. It then trains a Random Forest Regressor model to predict restaurant ratings based on various features.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, numpy

## Usage

1. Install the required libraries using `pip install pandas scikit-learn numpy`.
2. Run `restaurant_rating_prediction.py`.
3. The script will load the dataset, preprocess it, train the model, and provide an example prediction.

## Dataset

The project uses the Zomato restaurant dataset for Bangalore. You can find the dataset at [link to dataset](provide_link_here).
