# Zomato-Rating-Prediction
"Predict restaurant ratings using ML. Python script for data preprocessing, Random Forest Regressor training, and rating prediction."

This project focuses on predicting restaurant ratings using a machine learning model. The Python script provided covers the entire process, from data preprocessing to model training and prediction.

## Overview

- `Zomato rating prediction.ipynby`: This script loads a restaurant dataset, performs data preprocessing including handling missing values and one-hot encoding categorical features. It then trains a Random Forest Regressor model to predict restaurant ratings based on various features.

## Code
`Zomato analysis.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook performing data analysis and cleaning on the Zomato restaurant dataset.
- `Zomato rating prediction.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook for building the prediction model using the preprocessed data.

**Concept:**
This project embodies the concept of assisting hotel owners in predicting their restaurant's ratings even before being listed on platforms like Zomato. Utilizing a Random Forest Regressor, the project analyzes various features to provide an accurate rating estimation, empowering restaurant owners with valuable insights.

**Future Scope:**
The project's potential expansion lies in creating a user-friendly interface tailored for restaurant owners. By integrating real-time data collection and sentiment analysis, the application could offer a comprehensive pre-listing rating prediction tool, aiding owners in optimizing their services before entering online platforms.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, numpy

## Usage

1. Install the required libraries using `pip install pandas scikit-learn numpy`.
2. Run `Zomato rating prediction.ipynb`.
3. The script will load the dataset, preprocess it, train the model, and provide an example prediction.
